## Major Project 2021 Machine Learning [Materials Informatics Project]

### Author: Radhi Priya J
### Institution: Temasek Polytechnic
### Collaboration with: Kitakyushu NIT, Japan

#### 1. Introduction

Materials Informatics is an area of research that applies the principles of data science to materials science and engineering in order to improve the awareness, use, collection, creation and discovery of materials. Examples include property optimization, design of experiments and product performance optimization.

#### 2. Objectives of the Project

The main objective of this project is to develop a software package which will be used by experimentalists. The secondary objective of this project is to develop good models to predict the performance of materials from the experimental conditions provided as well as to develop good classifiers to recognize whether the material is good or bad from the image data taken by the experimentalists. 


#### 3. Scope of the Project
•	Develop software package for materials informatics
•	Implement recent machine learning techniques for experimental data on chemical physics and to identify the experimental conditions for obtaining good materials.
