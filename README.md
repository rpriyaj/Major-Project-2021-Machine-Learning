#### 1. Introduction

Materials Informatics is an area of research that applies the principles of data science to materials science and engineering in order to improve the awareness, use, collection, creation and discovery of materials. Examples include property optimization, design of experiments and product performance optimization.

#### 2. Objectives of the Project

The main objective of this project is to develop a software package which will be used by experimentalists. The secondary objective of this project is to develop good models to predict the performance of materials from the experimental conditions provided as well as to develop good classifiers to recognize whether the material is good or bad from the image data taken by the experimentalists. 


#### 3. Scope of the Project
•	Develop software package for materials informatics

•	Implement recent machine learning techniques for experimental data on chemical physics and to identify the experimental conditions for obtaining good materials.

#### 4. Project Details
1. To develop an user interface to deploy the software, tkinter package ("Tk interface") was used.
2. It is the standard Python Interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
3. Interface allow experimentalists to import a CSV file and select a Regression Method.
4. Upon selecting a regression method, a dialog opens for users to enter hyperparameter values for the chosen method.
5. After which, results from the regression analysis will be displayed.

#### 5. Key Benefits
1. Financially less burden for material scientistis to carry out experiments
2. Ability to try out different formulations in least amount of time

#### 6. Key Technologies used
- Visual Studio Code
- Tkinter Library
- Python

#### 7. Potential Enhancements
- Include automatic hyperparameter tuning to automatically improve accuracy
- Implement different types of models to try and test out different formulations
